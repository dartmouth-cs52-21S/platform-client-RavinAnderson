## What Worked Well
Learning Redux was a super cool experience and applying some of the logic from Lab 3 turned out to be pretty simple. Styling has become extremely achievable, flexboxes for the win. The format for tackling these projects has become clearer in the process of doing this lab, and I feel like I understand why things are happening the way they are. Passing down information with props is less confusing now and despite some difficulty with rendering, I have a new found appreciation for the breakdown of conditionals using other functions.

## What Didn't
This lab took a really long time and was a huge learning effort for me. Doing it on top of other work took motivation and lots of hours of debugging in the middle of the night. The TAs were super helpful in pointing me to resources to learn more of the material and explore documentation to see some of the cool things I could do. 

## Extra Credit
I implemented input validation (checking to see whether each field was filled when creating a new post) and a search feature for tags. To see the entire list of posts just delete what is in the search box.
