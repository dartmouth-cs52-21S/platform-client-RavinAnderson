# StarterPack for React Lab
[StarterPack in Action](https://stoic-williams-0fcd6a.netlify.app/)

## What Worked Well
Getting everything installed made sense because of the step-by-step guide provided. I didn't have any questions about the content, and I liked how everything was explained.

## What Didn't
I wasn't sure about the image in the folder, so I needed some clarification. When I installed additional compression/optimization rules, they conflicted with file-loader and I had to comment it out.

## Extra Credit
I added more robust image loading. In particular, I used https://iamakulov.com/notes/optimize-images-webpack/ and downloaded url-loader, svg-url-loader, and image-webpack-loader. Then I downloaded a CompressionWebpackPlugin using https://webpack.js.org/plugins/compression-webpack-plugin/.
